# Dictionary Anywhere

Dictionary extension that helps you stay focused on what you are reading by eliminating the need to search for meaning, Double-clicking any word will view its definition in a small pop-up bubble. Now you never have to leave what you are reading to search meaning for the words you don't know.

## History

This project is a fork from a [Dictionary Anywhere](#) of [Suraj Jain](#)! I am a heavy user of that extension, despire of a really good extension, it's have some limit. I want:
- Not only use dictionary from Google, but also from public 
- I suffer from constantly asked for reCAPTCHA from Google. So, I give a fix.
- Heuristic function...
- Caching old result. :D

## Install

Extension is waiting for approve from Firefox and Chrome to display from the store.

## Thank you

- [Suraj Jain](#) for inspire me create this extension
- Boilerplate
